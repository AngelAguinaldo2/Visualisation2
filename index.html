        <h1 id="bigTitle">EXPLORING MELBOURNE</h1>
        <p>Named the world's <b>most liveable city</b> between the years 2011 to 2017, Melbourne has been a <b>popular tourist destination </b>  
            for people all over the world. It boasts a vibrant arts, food, coffee,  and live music culture,
            playing host to many concerts and festivals. Recently recognised as a <b>UNESCO City of Literature</b>, it is home
            to many independent writers, publishers, and bookstores. One such notable bookstore was <b>Cole's Book Arcade</b>.
            This famous book store was popular during the Marvelous Melbourne period for its outlandish displays whic
            involved circuses and wild gadgets and gizmos. Now a Melbourne landmark, the remnants Coles book arcade can
            be found in Bourke Street Mall. Walking the streets of Melbourne is a fantastic way of discovering its rich 
            history through <b>landmarks and old establishments </b>. 
            <br>
            <br>
            When exploring a new city, it is often a good idea to join a walking tour to take you through the many famous 
            sights and local haunts. Self guided walking tours provide the same benefits, with the added extra bonus of 
            setting your own pace. Allowing the freedom to greater explore the places on the route and discover hidden gems.
            The purpose of this visualisation is to facillitate the exploration of Melbourne by providing data on walking trails,
            bus stops and routes, landmarks, and interesting environmental details strewn across the city centre.
